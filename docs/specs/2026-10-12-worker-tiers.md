# Worker tiers — design (2026-10-12)

Status: **built 2026-10-12 (commits d231fde, ba4d1a8, 7160945, 9b3529e).** Supersedes docs/specs/2026-10-11-worker-ladder.md (presets, field
overrides and "더 세밀하게" go away; the four rungs survive under new names).

Revised 2026-10-12: the main chat no longer names a tier. It only decides whether to delegate, and
always to `ripple:auto`; the judge picks among all four tiers, `max` included (deep + plan). The
four tier agents (`ripple:low/medium/high/max`) are no longer registered.

## Why

The ladder was still too much to set: presets, four rungs × model × effort × backup, two field
overrides, nine hidden fields. Community survey (2026-10-12, eight research workers; second-hand
claims) agreed on three points:

- People fix one model per role and leave it. Praised UIs are one switch (Cline: separate plan/act
  model) or one dial (Amp: mode).
- Auto-routing is disliked when it hides which model worked, or misjudges difficulty from the
  prompt alone.
- Better signals than prompt text: the orchestrator choosing, and stepping up on failure.

The main chat already knows the whole conversation; the judge sees one description. The first
build therefore had the **main chat name the tier**. Revised 2026-10-12: the main chat only
decides **whether** to delegate; the judge names the tier and the mod decides **which model**
serves it. A failed attempt reaches the judge as part of the next task's prompt.

## Model

Four workers, named by the effort words AI users already know (Claude Code effort, OpenAI
reasoning effort):

| Worker | Rung | Judge verdict | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| 로우 워커 | light | light | finding files, single lookups, skimming logs, mechanical edits |
| 미디움 워커 | standard | standard | specified implementation, refactors, summaries, drafts |
| 하이 워커 | hard | deep + do | hard debugging, multi-file changes, independent review and rebuttal |
| 맥스 워커 | plan | deep + plan | the best result available: planning, design, architecture, design decisions |

The workers are rungs, not agents (2026-10-12 revision): the only agent is `ripple:auto`, and the
judge picks one of the four (`ladder.ts` `rungOf`). An unsure verdict (`sure` < 0.5) moves up one
rung, low → medium → high; it never reaches max, which only a deep planning verdict does.

**Who decides what**

- Main chat: only whether to delegate, always to `ripple:auto`. Nothing in the user's CLAUDE.md;
  the agent's `description` (shipped in the plugin, always visible in the Agent tool list) says so.
  Distributable as is.
- Judge: how hard the task is — one of low/medium/high/max (light / standard / deep + do /
  deep + plan).
- Mod: which model and effort serve the tier, from the models the user ticked; skips providers
  that are off, out of quota or failing (402/429/5xx) and says so (existing `fallbackReason`);
  respects billing class.
- **Failure re-delegates once:** when a worker errors or returns no usable result, the main chat
  delegates to `ripple:auto` once more and says the earlier attempt failed (the `auto`
  description asks for this). The judge reads that as one level harder.
- Always visible: the task list label shows the model ("Astra·high · …"); every pick is logged as
  now (`worker pick:`, with its rung).

**Revised 2026-10-15: the main chat may name the tier.** The judge overcalled: of 64 delegations
(2026-10-12..15) it sent 48 to hard, because a brief's warnings ("read-only", "do not restart")
read as high stakes. Re-judged with tighter level wording (`judge.ts` `levelCriteria`) it gave
32; Opus, shown each delegation's recent conversation and brief under the description below,
gave 18 (light 1, standard 43, max 0).

- `ripple:auto`'s description (`workers.ts` `AUTO_DESCRIPTION`, still no CLAUDE.md needed) asks
  for `[[ripple: light|standard|hard|max]]` on the prompt's first line when the main chat knows,
  and to leave it out when unsure. `TIER_MARKERS` maps them to the verdicts `rungOf` reads; the
  marker is stripped before the worker or the router sees it (on any other worker it is just
  dropped, never routed as a model).
- With a marker the spawn does not wait for the judge. The judge still rates the same brief
  (`shadowJudge`), only into the log.
- No marker: the judge decides, as before.

**The pick log decides whether the judge stays.** `~/.clauderipple/logs/worker-picks.jsonl`,
3,000 lines, three line types joined by the pick's `id`:

| `type` | written | fields |
|---|---|---|
| `pick` | at spawn | `by` (`session`/`haiku`/`jev`/`model`/`marker`/`default`), `tier`, `verdict` (with Jev's per-question `odds`), `rung`, `model`, `effort`, `promptChars` |
| `shadow` | after a session-tiered spawn | the judge's `verdict`, its `rung`, `judge`, `ms` |
| `outcome` | when the worker's turn completes | `reason` (`answer`/`aborted`/`refusal`/`error`), `aborted`, `ms`, `answerChars`, `cost` (weighted tokens) |

Lines before 2026-10-15 have no `type` (picks only). The brief itself is never logged; to re-judge
a pick, take its brief from the session transcript under the same description. A re-delegation
("the earlier attempt failed") is a later pick whose brief says so: the clearest sign the tier
was too low.

## Filling the tiers

The shared ticked-model list supplies every worker set. Each rung is an ordered `Step[]`, each
step `{target, effort}`. An empty rung is filled with one model by `fillLadder`'s existing
`claudeGpt` rule. Existing lists, including unticked or unavailable entries, are kept unchanged.
At dispatch, try each entry in order; skip missing, unticked, switched-off, quota-exhausted or
runtime-exhausted providers. Only when the whole list fails, try the list one rung up, then the
session model (never down or two rungs up). The pick log records its 1-based position and every
skipped model/reason; the fallback toast names the skipped model and reason.

## Operating modes

A mode is a saved worker set, not a prefer/avoid policy. **No mode is built in**. The user supplies
its name; `기본` (Base) means the base worker set, not a saved mode.

- **Name** — user-typed, up to 40 characters.
- **Rungs** — its own light/standard/hard/plan ordered lists (로우/미디움/하이/맥스), the same
  `Step[]` shape and ticked-model/effort options as Base. New modes copy Base, without aliasing it.
- **Delegation** — `normal` or `eager` (보통 / 적극 — 메인 대화는 지휘만). The main chat may run on
  any model, so no string names Claude as the one directing. Eager adds the existing
  hidden `prompt.submit` context note: "Delegate everything except judgment and final review to
  ripple:auto." First prompt after activation and after main-chat compaction only.
- **End** — `until: 'none' | number | { reset: '<provider>' }`: until turned off, epoch-ms time,
  or the named provider's first known quota reset **after activation** (끄기 전까지 / 시각 지정 /
  한도 초기화 때). Only that provider's reset counts, whatever the rung lists use.
  `'anthropic'` is Claude: the mod's received `SessionRateLimit.resetsAt`, the five-hour or
  seven-day window with the highest `percentUsed`, exactly as the band chooses its binding limit
  (input order breaks ties); do not extrapolate Claude's lazily started five-hour windows. Any
  other name is a ChatGPT provider: its signed-in, unpaused accounts' primary/secondary windows
  from `/api/chatgpt-accounts?provider=<name>`. Previously observed deadlines are checked before
  replacing a rolled-forward snapshot. Unknown resets never end a mode. Stored `'reset'` (before
  2026-10-12: any used provider's) loads as `{ reset: 'chatgpt' }` when any rung entry is a worker
  rather than Claude's own, else `{ reset: 'anthropic' }` — settings carry no worker provider, and
  ChatGPT is the only worker provider with a known reset.
  The dashboard: choosing 한도 초기화 때 shows a provider menu of only the providers whose future
  reset is known now (ChatGPT ones, then Claude), labelled "ChatGPT 한도 초기화 때" / "Claude 한도
  초기화 때"; the line under 종료 시점 names the chosen provider. It starts on a known provider the
  mode's workers use, else the first known. With none known, the choice remains visible but
  disabled, with the reason directly beside it, not a floating note.

Only one mode is active. Its lists replace Base's for routing; the same ordered fallback applies.
Explicit markers remain explicit. The band and every worker-pick log show the active mode name.
Time/reset expiration clears activation and displays one toast; the saved worker set remains.

## Screens

**Dashboard `#mod` → Workers card:**
1. 적용 대상 (off / ripple workers / all subagents) — as now.
2. Tabs: `[기본] [user mode names…] [+ 새 모드]`. The active set is marked independently of
   the tab being edited. The ticked-model list lives only on Base and is shared by every tab.
3. Every tab has four worker rows, each an ordered list of model·effort selects, ↑/↓ reorder,
   remove (minimum one), and `+ 모델 추가`.
4. A saved-mode tab also has editable name, delegation, end, delete and an explicit
   `이 모드 켜기/끄기` control. Creating a mode asks for a name and copies Base's lists.

**In-session quick settings:** active mode select (Base + saved modes) only for worker settings;
individual workers are edited on the dashboard. Existing effort/judge/cache controls stay.

## Migration

- Ladder rungs Light/Standard/Hard/Plan → low/medium/high/max, models and efforts kept.
- A stored single Step loads as a one-item list, in Base and every mode.
- Old target/action modes copy the current normalized Base ladder on load, dropping target/action;
  name, delegation and end survive. Existing saved lists remain independent of later Base edits.
- Field overrides and "더 세밀하게" rules are dropped; the card shows a one-time line saying so.
- Auto (experimental, AA floors) is removed; `ripple:auto` uses the judge + tiers above.

## Acceptance

Ten-task probe (as 2026-10-11) dispatched by the main chat to `ripple:auto` without hints: the
judge lands each on a sensible tier, a planning/architecture task on max; every pick logged with
rung + model; a forced 402 on the low model steps to the next available model and shows the
reason; a failed task is re-delegated to `ripple:auto` once, saying the earlier attempt failed,
and the judge lands it one level up.
